# Git Setup Instructions

Since Git was not available during project creation, please follow these steps to initialize your repository:

## 1. Install Git (if not already installed)
- Download from: https://git-scm.com/download/windows
- Install with default settings

## 2. Initialize Repository
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Welfare Management System

- Next.js 14 with TypeScript setup
- Prisma database schema (PostgreSQL)
- Member management (CRUD operations)
- Payment tracking system
- Loan management foundation
- Tailwind CSS styling
- Vercel deployment configuration
- CSV export functionality
- Comprehensive documentation"
```

## 3. Connect to Remote Repository (Optional)
```bash
# Add your remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/welfare-management-system.git

# Push to remote
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 4. Future Development
```bash
# Create feature branches for new features
git checkout -b feature/loan-management
git checkout -b feature/authentication
git checkout -b feature/dashboard-improvements

# Make commits with clear messages
git add .
git commit -m "Add: loan application form"
git push origin feature/loan-management
```

This will create a proper Git history for your welfare management system project.
