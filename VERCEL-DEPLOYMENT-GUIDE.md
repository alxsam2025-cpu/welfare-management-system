- ‚úÖ A database (we'll set up a free PostgreSQL database)

---

## üîß Step 1: Prepare Your Project for Production

### Create Production Configuration Files

First, let's create the necessary configuration files for deployment:

**1. Create `.env.example` file:**
```bash
# Copy your current .env to create an example
cp .env .env.example
```

**2. Edit `.env.example` to remove sensitive values:**
```env
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL="your-database-url-here"

# NextAuth Configuration
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-nextauth-secret-here"
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://your-app-name.vercel.app"

# Email Configuration
EMAIL_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"
EMAIL_PORT="587"
EMAIL_USER="your-email@gmail.com"
EMAIL_PASSWORD="your-app-password"
EMAIL_FROM="your-email@gmail.com"

# Admin Configuration
ADMIN_EMAIL="admin@your-domain.com"
ADMIN_NAME="System Administrator"

# File Upload Configuration
MAX_FILE_SIZE="10485760"
UPLOAD_PATH="public/uploads"

# Application Configuration
APP_NAME="Welfare Management System"
APP_URL="https://your-app-name.vercel.app"
```

### Create Vercel Configuration

**Create `vercel.json` in your project root:**
```json
{
  "framework": "nextjs",

  "devCommand": "npm run dev",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "functions": {
    "app/**/*.ts": {
      "maxDuration": 30
    },
    "app/api/**/*.ts": {
      "maxDuration": 30
    }
  },
  "env": {
    "NODE_ENV": "production"
  }
}
```

### Update package.json Scripts

**Make sure your `package.json` has these scripts:**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint",
    "db:generate": "prisma generate",
    "db:push": "prisma db push",

npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy (from your project directory)
vercel

# Follow the prompts:
# - Set up and deploy? Y
# - Which scope? (select your account)
# - Link to existing project? N
# - What's your project's name? welfare-management-system
# - In which directory is your code located? ./
```

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Step 5: Set Up Production Database

### Initialize Database Schema

After deployment, you need to set up your database:

1. **Go to your Vercel project dashboard**
2. **Open the "Functions" tab**  
3. **Find the deployment and click "View Logs"**
4. **Or use Vercel CLI to run database commands:**

```bash
# Connect to your deployed project
vercel link

# Run database migration
vercel env pull .env.local
npm run db:push
```

### Alternative: Direct Database Setup

If using Vercel Postgres:

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Go to "Storage" tab
4. Click on your database
5. Go to "Query" tab
6. You can run SQL commands directly or connect via the connection string

---

## üîê Step 6: Configure Environment Variables

### Generate NextAuth Secret

```bash
# Generate a secure secret (run this locally)
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Or use an online generator: https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32

### Update Environment Variables

In your Vercel dashboard:

1. Go to your project
2. Click "Settings"
3. Click "Environment Variables"
4. Add/Update these key variables:

```
NEXTAUTH_SECRET = your-generated-secret-here
NEXTAUTH_URL = https://your-actual-deployed-url.vercel.app
DATABASE_URL = your-production-database-connection-string
APP_URL = https://your-actual-deployed-url.vercel.app
```

**After adding environment variables, redeploy:**
- Go to "Deployments" tab
- Click the three dots on the latest deployment
- Click "Redeploy"

---

## üìÅ Step 7: Handle File Uploads

### Important Note About File Uploads on Vercel

Vercel's serverless functions have limitations for file uploads:
- Files uploaded to `/public` folder are **not persistent**
- Files are lost between deployments
- Maximum file size is limited

### Recommended Solutions:

#### Option A: Vercel Blob (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Vercel Blob
npm install @vercel/blob
```

Update your file upload API to use Vercel Blob storage.

#### Option B: AWS S3
```bash
# Install AWS SDK
npm install aws-sdk
```

#### Option C: Cloudinary
```bash
# Install Cloudinary
npm install cloudinary
```

### Quick Fix for Testing
For now, your file upload will work but files may be lost between deployments. For production, implement one of the above solutions.

---

## üß™ Step 8: Test Your Deployment

### 1. Access Your Application
- Your app will be available at: `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`
- Test all major features:
  - ‚úÖ Homepage loads
  - ‚úÖ Navigation works
  - ‚úÖ Member management
  - ‚úÖ Payment tracking
  - ‚úÖ Loan application form
  - ‚úÖ Document upload (may need cloud storage for production)
  - ‚úÖ Admin interface

### 2. Check Database Connection
- Try creating a member
- Submit a loan application
- Test admin functions

### 3. Test Email Notifications
- Configure your email settings
- Test notification sending

## üîÑ Step 9: Set Up Automatic Deployments

### GitHub Integration Benefits
With Vercel + GitHub integration, you get:
- ‚úÖ **Automatic deployments** on every push to main branch
- ‚úÖ **Preview deployments** for pull requests
- ‚úÖ **Rollback capability** to previous deployments
- ‚úÖ **Branch deployments** for testing

### How It Works
```bash
# Make changes to your code
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin main

# Vercel automatically detects the push and deploys!
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 10: Production Optimizations

### Database Optimizations
```bash
# Run this after deployment to optimize database
vercel env pull .env.local
npm run db:generate
```

### Performance Monitoring
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Check "Analytics" tab for performance metrics
3. Monitor "Functions" tab for API performance

### Custom Domain (Optional)
1. Buy a domain (e.g., `yourwelfaresystem.com`)
2. In Vercel dashboard, go to project settings
3. Click "Domains"
4. Add your custom domain
5. Follow DNS configuration instructions
